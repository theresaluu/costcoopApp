# CostCoop â€” Cus no one has room for 50 rolls TP

This was created so I could learn AngularJS during my WDI experience in Summer 2013.  It was the first time the instructors were teaching Angular so we had a lot of self-learning so this def needs a rework.  I plan on doing this again but with Yeoman and with a Heroku deployment vs GH-pages.  GH-pages is slightly easier but there is a lag that exists between push and actual live render. 

Will post links to redone project when they are established.
